Note [order of generation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Clash core (as with GHC core), there is a degree of circularity:

  * A type can be a type constructor (referenced by name)
  * A type constructor has a type (kind)
  * A data constructor has a type
  * A type constructor may contain data constructors

This makes it impossible to naively write a generator for these parts of the
core IR, as such a generator may never terminate. However not everything
generated is completely random, e.g. the codomain of a data constructor is
always the type constructor the data constructor belongs to.

A reasonable approximation of a real program can be made by first generating
an environment, then generating things which exist within that environment. To
that end, the first thing (typically) to generate is a TyConMap, which contains
information about all type constructors that exist. This leads to a sensible
order of generation, e.g.

  * generate a TyConMap, `tcm`
  * generate a kind that exists in `tcm`, `k`
  * generate a type of kind `k` that exists in `tcm`, `a`
  * generate a term of type `a` that exists in `tcm`

By generating the TyConMap first, the generation of complete programs becomes
a more manageable process of running increasingly more constrained generators.
This helps ensure that generated data is well-formed, as a constrained
generator produces random hole-fits instead of completely arbitrary values.

Note [generating substs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When generating a FunTyCon, we generate a sequence of alternatives like so:

  type family F t_1 t_2 ... t_n :: k where
    F a_1 a_2 ... a_n = k_1
    F b_1 b_2 ... b_n = k_2
    ...

In "real" code, these would typically be written in a way where no alternatives
become dead, i.e. if you start with

  F v_1 v_2 ... v_n

where all arguments v_1 are type variables, this pattern will always be used
and the other alternatives never considered. To ensure FunTyCon are more
realistic, alternatives should be ordered from more specific to more general.

We can achieve this by starting from the most general solution and working
towards a more specific solution. At each step we can either return the list
of alternatives, or make a more specific alternative based on the previous
most specific alternative and put this at the head of the list. The returned
list is then guaranteed to not have any dead alternatives. Multiple of these
lists can be merged provided the merge operation preserves the ordering of
more to less specific.

If there is need to test type families where some alternatives may be dead, we
can use Gen.shuffle to rearrange the substs before taking a subsequence.
